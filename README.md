# Responsive Porfolio
## Description
Mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The site contain a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images. The navbar collapses to a button and the portfolio cards stack in a single column when the screen size is less than md (medium). The responsive behavior is built entirely with Bootstrap. The portfolio does not use any additional media queries. The HTML code was validated at [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
