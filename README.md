# Responsive Porfolio
## Description
Mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The site contains a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images. The navbar collapses to a button and the portfolio cards stack in a single column when the screen size is less than medium. The responsive behavior is built entirely with Bootstrap. The portfolio does not use any additional media queries. The HTML code was validated at [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

Deployed at [GitHub Pages](https://danielryangreen.github.io/portfolio/).
