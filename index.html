      <p>I am employed by HDR as a senior civil engineer with 24 years of experience. I specialize in planning and scheduling for major transportation projects using Oracle Primavera P6 software. I review and approve schedule submittals from construction contractors. Sometimes I also develop engineering schedules to support our design work and construction schedules to support our cost estimating work.</p>
      <P>I was raised in a small town in central Illinois. I spent the first 16 years of my career working for major construction contractors, including Traylor Bros. and Kiewit, and moving from project to project every couple of years. I have lived and worked in Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Arizona, and now Utah. I have also spent a lot of time working on projects in California and North Carolina.</P>
      <p>I moved to Salt Lake City in 2008 to be the Schedule Manager for the Utah Transit Authority's West Valley and Airport TRAX projects. I met my wife, who is also a civil enginer, and decided to stay here. After the UTA projects were finished, I worked for Williams Northwest Pipeline for about 5 years and then joined HDR in 2017.</p>
      <p>In March 2020, I started teaching myself Excel VBA and building an application to analyze data from Primavera P6. I discovered that I really enjoy coding, and I wanted to learn more. I am currently a student at the University of Utah Professional Education Coding Boot Camp learning full-stack web development. I expect to graduate with a certificate in May 2021.</p>
      <p>When I'm not scheduling or coding, I enjoy rock climbing, skiing, and backpacking with my wife. Utah is a great place to live with a lifetime of outdoor adventures.</p>
